Hello, This is a frontend mentor challenge. https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db

Made with Vanilla Javascript.

Continued devellopement: I wish to 

<ul>
  <li>Add a try catch block in the loadData function to handle errors. EDIT: Done</li>
  <li>Add a little animation on the dice image</li>
  <li>Change the dice image into a clickable button to show a new advice slip instead of needing to refresh the page</li>
</ul>

I had fun with this challenge, here is a LIVE VERSION on <a href="https://codepen.io/nv83-github/pen/PoQewoM">Codepen<a/>.
